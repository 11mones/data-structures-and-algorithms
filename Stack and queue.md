# Stack and queue
I have to implement the stack and queue, and create some methods for each one ie: pushing, popping, peeking, and run tests on it that covers all of that including the edge cases

## Whiteboard Process
There is no whiteboard for this challenge.

## Approach & Efficiency
I implemented everything in the right way, and covered all tests including the edge cases and all tests are passing (except the exceptions that required of course)

## Solution
To run the code: 

        python implementation.py

To run the tests :

        pytest implementation_test.py
